## 🚀 Option A: Keep Everything As-Is (Default)

**Do NOTHING!**

Your app continues to work perfectly:
```powershell
python run_app.py
# All 17 endpoints work on http://localhost:5002/api/pregnancy/*
```

---

## 🚀 Option B: Enable Enhanced Features

**One line change in `app/main.py`:**

### Step 1: Edit app/main.py

Open `patient/app/main.py` and find line 60:

**Replace this line:**
```python
app.register_blueprint(pregnancy_bp, url_prefix='/api/pregnancy')
```

**With this:**
```python
from app.modules.pregnancy.routes_enhanced import pregnancy_enhanced_bp
app.register_blueprint(pregnancy_enhanced_bp, url_prefix='/api/pregnancy')
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies (If Not Already)
```powershell
cd patient
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 3: Restart App
```powershell
python run_app.py
```

### Step 4: Test!
```powershell
# Existing endpoints (still work)
curl http://localhost:5002/api/pregnancy/week/20

# New enhanced endpoints (now available)
curl "http://localhost:5002/api/pregnancy/week/20/enhanced?patient_id=PAT123"
curl "http://localhost:5002/api/pregnancy/search?query=nutrition&limit=3"
```

**That's it!** All 20 endpoints now active!
