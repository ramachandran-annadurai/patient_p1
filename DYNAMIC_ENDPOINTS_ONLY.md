## üéØ **Key Points**

### **‚úÖ What Makes It Dynamic:**

1. **Reads `pregnancy_week` from Patient Database**
   ```python
   patient = db.patients_collection.find_one({"patient_id": patient_id})
   current_week = patient['pregnancy_week']  # e.g., 15
   ```

2. **Extracts `patient_id` from JWT Token**
   ```python
   token ‚Üí patient_id ‚Üí database ‚Üí pregnancy_week
   ```

3. **Uses Patient's Week Automatically**
   ```python
   # You call: /my-baby-image
   # System uses: patient's week 15
   # Returns: Apple image (week 15 baby size)
   ```

---

## üí° **Examples**

### **Patient at Week 5**:
```bash
GET /api/trimester/my-baby-image

```

**Same endpoint, different images based on patient's week!** üéØ

---

## üîß **How Patient Week is Set**

The patient's `pregnancy_week` is stored in the database. It can be:

1. **Manually set** when patient registers
2. **Calculated from LMP date** (Last Menstrual Period)
3. **Updated** as pregnancy progresses

The system reads it from these fields (in order):
- `patient.pregnancy_week`
- `patient.health_data.pregnancy_week`
- `patient.health_data.pregnancy_info.current_week`
- `patient.current_pregnancy_week`
